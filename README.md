## Developing history

### 20250312

- Created the repository and ready to construct the project.

### 20250314 Happy Valentine :P

- Added backEnd and frontEnd folder.
  - backEnd folder: Includes app.py and promptList with prompt.txt.
  - frontEnd folder: Includes index.html.
- The prompt example is just a demonstration of how to tell AI to give scores and feedback.
- For app.py the prompts can be modified and added into the system.
  - When changing the contents and the parameters in app.py, rememeber to add the same parameters in index.html.
- If wanna test out, please run app.py at first, then run index.html. (Both are local host, if wanna host with fixed IP need other stuffs.)
  - app.py's Environment API key requires openAI's API key to be set in the Environment. Thus, can not just execute then run.
